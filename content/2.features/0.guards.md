# Guards
The module provides two ways to protect routes from non-authenticated users :

## Client middleware
If you want to protect your routes from client, add the *guard* middleware to your pages.
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
definePageMeta({
  middleware: 'guard'
})
</script>
```

## Server middleware
If you want to restric access from server, set *guardSSR* to true & list the route you want to protect in *guardRoutes* :
```js
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  appwrite: {
	guardSSR: true,
    guardRoutes: ['/account', '/dashboard']
    // [.
  }
})
```
::list{type="warning"}
- **The server middleware affects nested routes too.** In our cases, any route in /account or /dashboard will be protected by middleware too.
